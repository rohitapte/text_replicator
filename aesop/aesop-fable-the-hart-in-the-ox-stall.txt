A Hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox-stall, and buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns.
Soon after the Hunters came up and asked if any one had seen the Hart.
The stable boys, who had been resting after their dinner, looked round, but could see nothing, and the Hunters went away.
Shortly afterwards the master came in, and looking round, saw that something unusual had taken place.
He pointed to the truss of hay and said: "What are those two curious things sticking out of the hay?"
And when the stable boys came to look they discovered the Hart, and soon made an end of him.
He thus learnt that: Nothing escapes the master's eye
