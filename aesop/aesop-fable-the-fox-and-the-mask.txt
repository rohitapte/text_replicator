A Fox had by some means got into the store-room of a theatre.
Suddenly he observed a face glaring down on him and began to be very frightened;
but looking more closely he found it was only a Mask such as actors use to put over their face.
"Ah," said the Fox, "you look very fine; it is a pity you have not got any brains."
