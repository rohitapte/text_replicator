It happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only a little fish.
"Pray, let me go, master," said the Fish. "I am much too small for your eating just now.
If you put me back into the river I shall soon grow, then you can make a fine meal off me.""Nay, nay, my little Fish," said the Fisher, "I have you now. I may not catch you hereafter."
