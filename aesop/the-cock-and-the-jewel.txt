A Cock, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious stone; on which he said:
"If thy owner had found thee, and not I, he would have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have found thee for no purpose.
I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world."
