A Fisherman who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a single small fish as the result of his day's labor.
The fish, panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life:
"O Sir, what good can I be to you, and how little am I worth! I am not yet come to my full size. Pray spare my life, and put me back into the sea. I shall soon become a large fish, fit for the tables of the rich; and then you can catch me again, and make a handsome profit of me."
The fisherman replied:
"I should be a very simple fellow, if I were to forego my certain gain for an uncertain profit."
