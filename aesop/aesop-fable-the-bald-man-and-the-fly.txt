There was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot summer's day.
A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate, and stinging him from time to time.
The Man aimed a blow at his little enemy, but his palm came on his head instead.
Again the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and said:
"You will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable enemies."
