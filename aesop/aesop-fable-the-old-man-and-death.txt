An old labourer, bent double with age and toil, was gathering sticks in a forest.
At last he grew so tired and hopeless that he threw down the bundle of sticks, and cried out:
"I cannot bear this life any longer. Ah, I wish Death would only come and take me!"As he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to him:
"What wouldst thou, Mortal? I heard thee call me.""Please, sir," replied the woodcutter,
"Would you kindly help me to lift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder?"
