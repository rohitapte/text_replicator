A Wolf coming out of a field of oats met with a Horse, and thus addressed him:
"I would advise you to go into that field. It is full of capital oats, which I have left untouched for you, as you are a friend the very sound of whose teeth it will be a pleasure to me to hear."
The Horse replied:
"If oats had been the food for wolves, you would never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly."
