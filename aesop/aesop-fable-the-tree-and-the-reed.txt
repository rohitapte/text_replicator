"Well, little one," said a Tree to a Reed that was growing at its foot, "why do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground, and raise your head boldly in the air as I do?""I am contented with my lot," said the Reed. "I may not be so grand, but I think I am safer.""Safe!" sneered the Tree. "Who shall pluck me up by the roots or bow my head to the ground?"
But it soon had to repent of its boasting, for a hurricane arose which tore it up from its roots, and cast it a useless log on the ground, while the little Reed, bending to the force of the wind, soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over.
