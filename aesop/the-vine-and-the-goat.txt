A Vine was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes.
A Goat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves.
The Vine said:
"Why do you thus injure me and crop my leaves? Is there no young grass left? But I shall not have to wait long for my just revenge; for if you now crop my leaves, and cut me down to my root, I shall provide the wine to pour over you when you are led as a victim to the sacrifice."
