The Lion and the Fox went hunting together.
The Lion, on the advice of the Fox, sent a message to the Ass, proposing to make an alliance between their two families.
The Ass came to the place of meeting, overjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance.
But when he came there the Lion simply pounced on the Ass, and said to the Fox:
"Here is our dinner for to-day. Watch you here while I go and have a nap. Woe betide you if you touch my prey."
The Lion went away and the Fox waited; but finding that his master did not return, ventured to take out the brains of the Ass and ate them up.
When the Lion came back he soon noticed the absence of the brains, and asked the Fox in a terrible voice:
"What have you done with the brains?""Brains, your Majesty! it had none, or it would never have fallen into your trap."
