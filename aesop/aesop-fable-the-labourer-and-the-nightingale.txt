A Labourer lay listening to a Nightingale's song throughout the summer night.
So pleased was he with it that the next night he set a trap for it and captured it.
"Now that I have caught thee," he cried, "thou shalt always sing to me.""We Nightingales never sing in a cage." said the bird."Then I'll eat thee." said the Labourer. "I have always heard say that a nightingale on toast is dainty morsel.""Nay, kill me not," said the Nightingale; "but let me free, and I'll tell thee three things far better worth than my poor body."
The Labourer let him loose, and he flew up to a branch of a tree and said:
"Never believe a captive's promise; that's one thing. Then again: Keep what you have. And third piece of advice is: Sorrow not over what is lost forever."
Then the song-bird flew away.
