A Fox after crossing a river got its tail entangled in a bush, and could not move.
A number of Mosquitoes seeing its plight settled upon it and enjoyed a good meal undisturbed by its tail.
A hedgehog strolling by took pity upon the Fox and went up to him:
"You are in a bad way, neighbour," said the hedgehog; "shall I relieve you by driving off those Mosquitoes who are sucking your blood?""Thank you, Master Hedgehog," said the Fox, "but I would rather not.""Why, how is that?" asked the hedgehog."Well, you see," was the answer, "these Mosquitoes have had their fill; if you drive these away, others will come with fresh appetite and bleed me to death."
