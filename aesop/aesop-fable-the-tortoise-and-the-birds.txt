A Tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an Eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her trouble.
The Eagle agreed and seizing the Tortoise by the shell with her talons soared aloft.
On their way they met a Crow, who said to the Eagle: "Tortoise is good eating."
"The shell is too hard," said the Eagle in reply.
"The rocks will soon crack the shell," was the Crow's answer; and the Eagle, taking the hint, let fall the Tortoise on a sharp rock, and the two birds made a hearty meal of the Tortoise.
