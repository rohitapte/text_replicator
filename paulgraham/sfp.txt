October 2005
The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.  We were
surprised how well it went.  Overall only about 10% of startups   
succeed, but if I had to guess now, I'd predict three or four of  
the eight startups we funded will make it.
Of the startups that needed further funding, I believe all have
either closed a round or are likely to soon.  Two have already
turned down (lowball) acquisition offers.
We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promising
by the end of the summer.  What's going on?  Did some kind of anomaly
make this summer's applicants especially good?  We worry about that,
but we can't think of one.  We'll find out this
